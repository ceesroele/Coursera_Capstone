# Business Problem

## Opportunity for starting new restaurants

Year over year the city of Riga receives more visitors. They come on business, to see family and friends,
to see the sights, and generally to enjoy spending time in the city. They need a place to stay. And they need a
place to eat.

The rise in the number of visitors means more potential restaurant customers and hence opportunity for starting new restaurants in the city.

Obviously, entrepreneurs starting a restaurant want it to be successful. Introducing his [*Top 20 factors for success in the restaurant business*](https://www.restobiz.ca/top-20-factors-success-restaurant-business/) (2016) Geoff Wilson writes:
> "*Success means different things to different people. Some operators want to just make a living. Others have loftier goals – maximization of market share, achievement of targeted return on investment and so on. Regardless of one’s definition of success, the basics in the restaurant industry never change.*"

Some factors for success are:
* Location
* Quality food
* Scheduling to balance labour to demand
* Empowered staff
* Menus engineered to yield optimum gross margin
* Participative management
* Winning attitude

These are out of scope of the current investigation.

We will focus on the **first** of Wilson's success factors:
> *Validated concept definition. Can you clearly state what experience your restaurant offers, **what products it serves** and what service-style it employs? If not, you’re not sure what your restaurant is all about and neither are your customers.*

Setting aside service-style, we will focus on *products served*, that is, on what kind of food a restaurant serves to its customers.

Visitors coming from abroad have built up expectations and tastes, possibly developed by visiting other cities. At the same time local customers develop new tastes over time, possibly also by travelling abroad.


## The problem we will address

Above we have seen that there is opportunity for opening new restaurants in Riga, that the first thing to be clear about is to know what kind of food to serve, but that it is uncertain what kind of food would have a relatively good chance of success.

The present investigation seeks to answer the following question of **prospective entrepreneurs** considering opening a restaurant in Riga: 

> *What kind of food served is relatively likely to make a restaurant successful in Riga?*
